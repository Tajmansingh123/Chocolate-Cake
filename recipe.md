Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius.
Place all ingredients in a bowl.
Beat with an electric beater until the mixture is smooth.
Beat for around three minutes. This is a fairly wet mixture and the beating is important.
Beat through enough to make a smooth batter but not too much that the air is taken out.
Pour into grease and base lined (baking paper on the bottom) cake tin.
Bake for approximately 40 minutes at 325°F (160°C) or until cooked when tested. 
Add frosting, sprinkles, and any other sorts of decoration.
